## Features

  ### 1) In the upper section, you'll find two distinct forms designed to enhance user interaction :
  
  - Username Search Form:
    - This form allows users to enter a specific username for searching purposes.
    - Upon submission, it not only searches and updates the entered username but also dynamically modifies the repository listings to display repositories associated with that username.
   
  - Repository Search Form:
    - The second form is dedicated to searching repositories within the already listed repositories of a specific user.

In conjunction with these forms, an intuitive filtering option is provided through a designated button. This filter empowers users to easily discern whether the repositories listed are forked or not, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.

  ### 2) In the lower section, you'll find a user-friendly interface featuring:

  - Pagination Controls:
    
      - Two buttons, labeled "Previous" and "Next," facilitate seamless navigation between pages when there are multiple repositories to display.
   
  - Page Size Configuration:

      - A dedicated button allows users to specify the number of repositories to be displayed per page.
      - By default, the page is set to showcase 10 repositories. However, for enhanced customization, users have the option to choose from three additional page size settings: 30, 50, and a maximum of 100 repositories per page. This flexibility ensures that users can tailor their viewing experience based on individual preferences and requirements.
